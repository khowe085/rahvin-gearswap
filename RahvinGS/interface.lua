-- SECTIONS 1-6 - THE JOB FILE INTERFACE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Section 1 - Version and shared globals
--   Section 2 - Gear set placeholders: the set paths the engine reads, created empty
--   Section 3 - Mode definitions: the M{} state variables and the ammunition tables
--   Section 4 - The busy flag, job file options, and the Job_Mode_Check helper
--   Section 5 - Action classification lists: which bucket each spell or move falls into
--   Section 6 - Display labels for the two job-defined modes
--
-- Everything here is global. A job file reads these names, writes them and overrides what
-- it needs, so this file speaks to players who edit job files as well as to maintainers.
--
-- This is the one component with no constructor. Every other engine file returns a
-- function(E) that the root builds. This one runs at the top level, exports nothing onto E,
-- and loads first, before any other engine file. The rest of the engine can therefore
-- assume these globals exist, and nothing in this file may read an engine internal, because
-- none exists yet.
--
-- Job_Mode_Check, in section 4, is the only function here. Nothing in the engine calls it.
-- It is a helper for job files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SECTION 1 - VERSION AND SHARED GLOBALS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The version, the Modes library and the received-gear registry, which the rest of the
-- engine expects to exist before it loads.

-- The version every component stamps itself against. The root compares each component's
-- returned stamp with this one, so a file left over from another version announces itself at
-- load rather than running mismatched.
Rahvin_GS = '2.1'

-- GearSwap's Modes library, which supplies the M{} class every state variable in section 3
-- is built from. It is included here because those declarations run in this file, before
-- any component exists.
include('Modes')

-- The registry of slots received gear is holding, keyed by the slot name the received set
-- uses. It is a global so the lifecycle teardown can empty it without reaching into the
-- spell-received component. That component replaces the table whole on every release, so
-- every reader looks the global up at each use rather than keeping a reference.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SECTION 2 - GEAR SET PLACEHOLDERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The fixed set paths the engine reads, created empty. A job file declares only the sets it
-- uses, and a set it leaves out merges as nothing rather than failing to exist. A job file
-- replaces these tables inside get_sets(), and the first set build after a load re-creates
-- any placeholder path the job file dropped. The engine records each placeholder before the
-- job file declares its sets, so its warnings can tell a set the job file never declared
-- from one it declared and left empty.

-- Weapons. The job file adds one child per WeaponMode option. Sleep is held on while the
-- character is asleep, Shield is the offhand merged under a one-handed main without Dual
-- Wield, and Songs holds the bard's song weapons.
