-- COMPONENT: monitor -- section 19: the polling engine, movement, traits and bursts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Section 19 - Automation and combat monitoring. The main polling engine and the
--   movement detection inside it, the two weapon-trait checks, skillchain burst tracking,
--   buff cancellation, the auto weaponskill, and the Escha temporary-item macro.
--
-- EXPORTS  autows_tp_change onto E, which the root registers on the tp change event. Its
--          other functions are globals, autows_sync among them, which commands.lua and
--          display.lua call. It writes these fields the state
--          component declares: is_moving, DualWield and TwoHand, the three
--          last_skillchain_* fields, and SpellCastTime, which it zeroes when a busy window
--          expires.
-- CALLERS  The root registers main_engine on the outgoing chunk event. th.lua calls
--          run_burst, commands.lua calls two_hand_check and escha_temps, and
--          spellreceived.lua calls cancel. The root and the lifecycle component also hand
--          dual_wield_check and two_hand_check to coroutine.schedule, so a search for
--          "dual_wield_check(" misses those uses.
-- LOADS    After every component whose exports it binds. Two globals it calls are declared
--          in files that load later: debug_box_update in the display component and
--          equip_set_command in the root. Neither may be bound in the import block below.
--          Both resolve because Lua reads a global at call time, and main_engine never runs
--          before the load completes. E.drag_settle, from the display component, is read
--          from E at the call for the same reason.
--
-- The reverse also holds. th.lua and spellreceived.lua load before this file, and their
-- calls to run_burst and cancel resolve at call time in the same way.

-- requires: rahvings/state, rahvings/core, rahvings/equip
