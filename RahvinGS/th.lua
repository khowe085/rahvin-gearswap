-- COMPONENT: th -- section 18: Treasure Hunter tracking, and the action handler
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Section 18 - Treasure Hunter tracking. Three event handlers and a timed sweep that
--   decide whether a mob still needs Treasure Hunter gear, and the action handler. The
--   action handler records tags, releases what an item use or an interrupted cast held,
--   dispatches skillchain bursts, and hands job ability packets to the eleven tracker.
--
-- EXPORTS  E.th_action, which the root registers on the raw 'action' event.
-- GLOBALS  on_target_change_for_th, on_incoming_chunk_for_th and on_zone_change_for_th,
--          which the root registers on their events, and cleanup_tagged_mobs, which the
--          polling engine calls on its 30 second pass.
-- STATE    The tagged-mob table is th_info.tagged_mobs. The state component owns th_info,
--          this file writes it, and the gear builders read it. Both files bind the th_info
--          reference once at construction, so th_info is changed in place and never
--          replaced. A replaced th_info would leave the builders reading the old one.
-- LOADS    After every component whose exports it binds. run_burst (monitor),
--          display_box_update (display) and equip_set_command (the root) are globals from
--          files that load after this one. They resolve when called, so none of them may be
--          bound in the import block.
--
-- The zone handler does more than its name suggests, and its steps run in a required
-- order. Read the note above it before moving anything inside it.

        -- fires when the player retargets by hand and when the client moves on from a target
