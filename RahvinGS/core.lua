-- CONTENTS
--   Section 7  - Libraries and settings .... the four libraries, the saved settings file,
--                                           and the two on-screen boxes
--   Section 8  - Shared constants .......... the constants and lookup tables other

--   Section 9  - Spell and ability data .... which incoming action calls for which set
--   Section 11 - Core utilities ............ the chat channels, the clock, the item and party
--                                           helpers, the elemental bonus chooser, and the
--                                           multibox cast announce
--
-- This file holds what the rest of the engine reads. It registers no event and runs no
-- subsystem of its own.
--
-- GLOBALS  print, and the five chat channels written through it: log, info, warn, notice and
--          gear_report. GearSwap gives the job file and every file it includes one shared
--          environment, so this print replaces Lua's for the engine and the job file alike.
--          It reads its first argument as a chat mode. debug is not a global. It is a
--          file-local that shadows Lua's debug table here and in every component that
--          imports it.
-- STATE    The live settings table, and the multibox announce debt: the flag
--          E.outgoing_cast_active, which state.lua declares, and the deadline beside it.
--          While the debt stands, other characters may be holding gear for a cast this
--          character announced.
-- EXPORTS  The settings table and what its load reported, the two boxes, the config,
--          resource and extdata libraries, the shared constants and data tables, and the
--          helper functions, all as E fields.
-- LOADS    After state.lua, because it binds state's cached handles at construction:
--          get_mob_by_id, get_party and send_ipc. This is the one place load order departs
--          from section order, since state holds section 10. Every global it calls exists
--          before it loads.

-- requires: rahvings/state
return function(E)
    -- The API handles state.lua caches, bound once so no call below reaches through E. The
    -- two other windower.ffxi calls in this file, for the client language and the stratagem
    -- recasts, have no cached handle and call windower.ffxi directly.

    -- The libraries the engine uses, the settings that persist across reloads, and the two
    -- on-screen boxes those settings describe.

    -- The four libraries the engine uses. config reads and writes the settings file, res
    -- holds the game's resource tables, socket supplies a wall clock, and extdata decodes
    -- the per-item data that holds enchantment charges and timers.
    --
    -- require here is GearSwap's include, not Lua's. It returns the table already loaded
    -- under that name in package.loaded. GearSwap has loaded all four before any job file
    -- runs, as well as the files and xml libraries the settings load uses below, so each
    -- call returns the addon's own copy.

    -- What the settings file holds on a first run, and the shape config.load merges a saved
    -- file into. The six booleans are the toggles commands.lua flips. delay is the multibox
    -- announce window in seconds, and the spell-received failsafe times against it too.
    --
    -- Every setting needs a key here. The config library lowercases each tag it parses and
    -- maps it back onto a default's spelling, so a key absent from this table lands under a
    -- lowercase name nothing reads.
