-- COMPONENT: builders -- section 15: the gear set builders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Section 15 - Turning the job file's declared sets into one table of gear, in five parts:
--     Shared merges ....... the Aftermath ladder, the weapon mode, the set families
--     The four builders ... choose_set, precastequip, midcastequip, aftercastequip
--     Conditional gear .... the element, day and weather bonus pieces
--     Bard songs .......... weapons, instruments, and the song-family ladder
--     Consumable checks ... ammunition and ninja tools, which can cancel the action
--
-- This is where the job file becomes gear. The builders hold one branch per kind of
-- action, and each branch merges a set the job file declared and names it to the merge
-- report.
--
-- Nothing here equips. Every builder returns a table and its caller equips it, so a build
-- can be reported, inspected or discarded without anything being worn.
--
-- interface.lua declares every set path and classification list this file reads without a
-- test. A set the job file never wrote is then an empty placeholder that merges nothing,
-- never a nil that throws. A path read here needs its placeholder there, or a test before
-- it is read.
--
-- The merge report is recorded here and printed elsewhere. Each builder opens it with
-- merge_report_begin and marks where its branch starts and ends. merge_report_flush, which
-- the hooks call after each build, turns that record into the line the player reads. A
-- merge made with merge_into rather than merge_report or merge_named is not recorded, so
-- that line does not name it.
--
-- EXPORTS  build_current_set, which hooks, commands, spellreceived and th take, and
--          apply_weapon_mode, reassert_pair and wears_yagrush, which hooks take. It also
--          writes the two prediction flags, accession_predicted and divine_seal_predicted,
--          which the state component declares and hooks and spellreceived also touch.
-- GLOBALS  choose_set, precastequip, midcastequip, aftercastequip and
--          check_equipment_spells, which the action hooks call. elemental_check,
--          build_song_weapons, build_song_set, equip_song_gear, equip_pianissimo_gear,
--          do_bullet_checks and do_Utsu_checks are called only from this file. They are
--          globals so the builders above them can call them, since a global resolves when
--          it is called.
-- LOADS    After the enchanted item engine, whose verify_locked_slots it binds. It calls no
--          global from a file that loads after it.

-- requires: rahvings/state, rahvings/core, rahvings/equip, rahvings/enchant
return function(E)
