-- globals, and a job file overrides them after this file returns.
include('RahvinGS/interface')

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- COMPONENT: the composition root -- section 23: construction and event registration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Above this block .. the license, and the job-file interface, included first
--   Construction ...... E, the version check, and the components in load order
--   Section 23 ........ the event registrations, equip_set_command, and the startup schedule
--
-- This is the only file that wires anything. Every other file builds its handlers, sets and
-- command tables and hands them back. Only this file includes an engine file, and only this
-- file registers a Windower event, so it is the one place to read for what runs when.
--
-- EXPORTS  Nothing onto E. One global, equip_set_command, which the components call. It
--          resolves late in every one of them, because this file defines it after they load.
-- LOADS    Last. This is the file a job file includes.

-- The do block keeps E, construct and the bindings below local to this file. A job file sees
-- sets, state, the interface globals and the globals the components define, and nothing
-- declared inside this block. Inside it, a local must be declared above its first use.
do
    -- The table every component shares. A component copies the immutable exports it needs
    -- into file-locals at construction, and reads the shared mutable fields through E at each
    -- use. A job file never sees it.
    local E = {}

    -- Construct one component and check it. Each component file returns a constructor that
    -- takes E and returns its version stamp. The first assert catches a file that returns no
    -- constructor, and the second catches a constructor from another engine version. Either
    -- way the load stops and names the file, rather than running a mismatched engine.
    local function construct(ctor, name)
        assert(type(ctor) == 'function', name .. ' did not return a constructor -- stale copy?')
        local v = ctor(E)
        assert(v == Rahvin_GS,
            name .. ' is version ' .. tostring(v) .. ' against engine ' .. Rahvin_GS .. ' -- stale copy?')
    end

    -- The components, in load order, which is not section order. state comes first because
    -- the components that use its cached handles bind them at construction, and it can come
    -- first because its initializers read only globals. core comes second with sections 7-9
    -- and 11. The rest follow section order through lifecycle.
    --
    -- include() does not cache, so each file appears here exactly once. A second inclusion
    -- would run the component's constructor twice against the same E.

    -- SECTION 23 - EVENT REGISTRATION AND STARTUP
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -- The Windower event registrations and the deferred startup schedule. Registration comes
    -- last because every handler, and every local it captures, must exist before Windower can
    -- call it. The components build the handlers as closures, so the state a handler reads
    -- stays an upvalue, and every one of them is registered here.

    -- Release every slot before anything else runs. GearSwap keeps a slot's disabled flag
    -- across job file loads, so a hold left by the previous load would otherwise refuse gear
    -- for the whole session. All sixteen are released, because no hold in this load exists yet.
    enable('main', 'sub', 'range', 'ammo', 'head', 'neck', 'lear', 'rear', 'body', 'hands', 'lring', 'rring', 'waist',
        'legs', 'feet', 'back')

    -- Three of Treasure Hunter's four hooks, and the polling engine. main_engine runs on each
    -- outgoing chunk, so the client's own traffic drives it rather than a timer.
    windower.register_event('target change', on_target_change_for_th)
    windower.raw_register_event('incoming chunk', on_incoming_chunk_for_th)
    windower.raw_register_event('outgoing chunk', main_engine)
    windower.raw_register_event('zone change', on_zone_change_for_th)

    -- Multibox: another character on this machine announcing a cast aimed at this one, and
    -- the eleven tracker's question and answer between characters after a load.
    windower.register_event('ipc message', E.sr_ipc_message)

    -- The two prerender drivers. prerender fires every frame whatever the client is sending,
    -- so these keep running while the character stands still, when main_engine may not tick.
    -- Each checks the clock before doing anything else.
    --
    -- They stay two registrations. Windower runs the handlers on one event in registration
    -- order and isolates their errors from each other, so an error in the Hoxne driver leaves
    -- the failsafe below running. One handler calling both would lose that.
    windower.raw_register_event('prerender', E.hoxne_prerender)

    -- The spell-received failsafe: it releases borrowed gear when a completion never arrives.
    windower.raw_register_event('prerender', E.sr_prerender)

    -- Buff gained: clears the two prediction flags, uses a status-removal item where the job
    -- file allows one, and dresses and holds gear for the ailments that need it.
    windower.register_event('gain buff', E.sr_gain_buff)

    -- Buff lost: releases what was held for that buff, clears the two prediction flags, and
    -- drops a Corsair roll from the eleven tracker.
    windower.register_event('lose buff', E.sr_lose_buff)

    -- TP changed: the auto weaponskill uses the chosen weaponskill once TP reaches its
    -- threshold. Registered wrapped, so player and buffactive are refreshed before it reads
    -- them. It equips nothing itself, since the /ws it sends runs the ordinary precast.
    windower.register_event('tp change', E.autows_tp_change)

    -- Logout: both display boxes come down, with whatever the renderer standing owns. The
    -- boxes are not rebuilt until after the next login, so without this they stay drawn over
    -- the character list. The handler also latches the display shut, which stops the
    -- per-frame drivers and the polling tick from drawing it again. The saved visible and
    -- debug preferences are left alone, so the rebuild puts each box back the way it was set.
    --
    -- Registered raw because the handler equips nothing. The wrapped form would run
    -- GearSwap's globals refresh and full set pass for a few hides.
    windower.raw_register_event('logout', E.display_logout)

    -- GearSwap's own console commands. GearSwap registered its handler for '//gs ...' when
    -- the addon loaded, so that handler runs first and has already acted. This one only
    -- prints the line that points a player at the tracked 'gs c' form. It is registered
    -- wrapped, not raw. It fires once per typed command, and the wrapper holds the line back
    -- while the job file itself is switched off, when the engine has nothing to say.
    windower.register_event('addon command', E.native_disable_notice)

    -- A worked example for a job file, commented out: reacting to a tell or to party chat.
    -- It registers nothing here.
    --[[
    windower.register_event('chat message', function(message, sender, mode, gm)
        -- Mode 3 is a tell and mode 4 is party chat. Anything else is ignored.
        if mode ~= 3 and mode ~= 4 then
            return
        end

        if message:contains('hqzerg') then
            windower.send_command('sm on')
        end
    end)
    ]] --

    -- Treasure Hunter's fourth hook, and the widest registration here: every action packet in
    -- range reaches it. Most of its work is gated on the actor being this player. The
    -- skillchain dispatch and the eleven tracker's roll read are not, so a skillchain closed
    -- by anyone opens a burst window, and a roll from any Corsair is read.
    windower.raw_register_event('action', E.th_action)

    -- This file's one global: ask for a gear rebuild by sending the self command that
    -- performs one. An equip made inside a raw event handler is never sent, and GearSwap runs
    -- a self command wrapped, so the rebuild lands. Components that load before this file
    -- call it, and it resolves late in every one of them.

    -- The startup schedule, deferred and staggered. Nothing here can run at load: the job
    -- file has not finished loading, so its sets do not exist yet, and the client has not
    -- settled. The steps run in the order each one needs. The job file's buff children are
    -- discovered and the legacy set names aliased. The boxes appear. The two weapon traits
    -- are read, and the weapon lock the job file may have set is bridged and resolved. Unlock
    -- frees every slot the lock does not hold and asks for a rebuild, then the polling engine
    -- takes over. The two notices come last, after everything they report on has run.
    --
    -- Discovery has a delay of its own rather than sharing the boxes' delay, because two
    -- schedules at one delay run in no stated order. The eleven tracker's question shares
    -- discovery's delay because the order of those two does not matter: every answer arrives
    -- in a later frame, after discovery has run.
