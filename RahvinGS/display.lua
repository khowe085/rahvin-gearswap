-- COMPONENT: display -- section 20: the on-screen status and debug boxes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CONTENTS
--   Section 20 - On-screen display. The appearance constants, the cached column layout and
--   the code that measures it, the hold group, the status-box renderers and their registry,
--   the hold map and its legend, and the debug box. Also the settings save every position
--   change goes through, the drag settle that writes a box drag out, and the logout hide that
--   takes both boxes off the screen and latches the display shut.
--
-- EXPORTS  save_settings, which the commands component uses too, so every save shares one
--          implementation and one set of refusals. display_styles and set_display_style, for
--          the style command. display_visible, for the display toggle. display_unload, for
--          the lifecycle teardown. display_logout, which the root registers on the logout
--          event, and display_logged_out, the latch it raises, which the commands component
--          reads. drag_settle, called by the monitor component's outgoing-chunk tick, and
--          drag_flush, called by the teardown before the boxes are destroyed. min_value_cells,
--          so the commands component reports the value-column floor as the box reads it.
--          repaint_slot, the rig's one-cell recolor, called by the equip and spell-received
--          components wherever a hold with no token takes or lets go of a slot.
-- GLOBALS  display_box_update, the status box redraw, called from many components and
--          scheduled by the root at startup. display_box_reset, debug_box_update,
--          debug_box_reset, display_zero_command and display_pos_command, for the commands
--          and the polling tick. settings_reset_announce, which the root schedules once the
--          client has settled. invalidate_layout, which the subjob change and the
--          displaycells command call.
-- LOADS    After monitor and before commands. It calls nothing that loads later. The equip,
--          enchant, spell-received, th and monitor components load before it and reach
--          display_box_update or debug_box_update as globals resolved at call time.
--
-- Both boxes are redrawn from paths that can run many times a second, so redrawing is kept
-- cheap. The column layout is measured once and cached. The status box paints through a
-- guard that skips handing a text object the string it already shows. The debug box compares
-- its six values and its hold map with the last draw, returns when none moved, and writes
-- its text object directly.

-- requires: rahvings/core, rahvings/equip, rahvings/spellreceived
return function(E)
    -- Immutable dependencies, bound once at construction. The debug box reads the
    -- spell-received failsafe through the E.sr_failsafe_active() accessor, because that flag
    -- is private to the spell-received component.

    -- prints it once in place of its reset lines.

    -- assigns each once and only ever changes it in place, so these references stay the live
    -- tables. The lock count and the standing strip shape change value, so they are read as E
    -- fields at every use. slot_claim is the arbiter the hold map asks, and CANON_SLOT turns a
